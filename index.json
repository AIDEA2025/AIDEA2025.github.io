Please prepare your abstract in PDF format, two pages incl. literature. You do not need to add an extra summary paragraph in the PDF, but you will be asked to add a few sentences of summary on the submission page. Please also provide the focus topic of your abstract, and nominate one of the authors as the presenting author. Submission is done via Open Review, an open source reviewing platform. At least the submitting author needs to create an account there. If possible, please create the account with an institutional email. Other emails are possible as well, but please note that there can be a 2 week delay as OpenReview has a manual moderation process in place. Once you logged in, you will be able to access the submission form. The abstract will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee on OpenReview. You will receive a short feedback in October. Hotel booking: We have reserved a room contingent at the Leonardo Boutique Hotel Salzburg Gablerbräu for the duration of the symposium. The rooms must be booked individually and initially paid for by the participants themselves. After the symposium, we will reimburse the maximum costs of 445€ if you have indicated that you are requesting a refund (5 nights at 89€ each, including breakfast). Double rooms can also be booked if you would like to bring an accompanying person. A double room costs 104€ per night. We are only able to provide a refund up to the amount of the single room (89€/night). If you wish to arrive earlier or depart later, please clarify this individually with the hotel. You can cancel your reservation free of charge until February 1st, 2025. After that, 90% of the full price will be due, which we unfortunately cannot refund in the event of a no-show. Booking is possible by email. Please enter the keyword communicated via email when booking and complete the booking by October 31, 2024 at the latest. Travel costs: Each participant must book the trip individually. Travel costs will be reimbursed after the symposium up to the specified upper limits (provided you have indicated that you are making use of the funding).
